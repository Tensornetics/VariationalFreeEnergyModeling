# Variational Free Energy Modeling System Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues
1. **Data processing error**: If the input data is incorrect or in the wrong format, the modeling results will be incorrect. Ensure that the input data is correct and in the correct format before running the modeling.

2. **Algorithm implementation error**: If the implementation of the Nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation solver, variational free energy minimization algorithm, or information bottleneck method is incorrect, the modeling results will be incorrect. Ensure that the algorithms have been implemented correctly.

3. **User interface error**: If the user interface is not functioning correctly, it may be difficult to interpret the modeling results. Ensure that the user interface is functioning correctly.

## Diagnosing Issues
1. Verify that the input data is correct and in the correct format.

2. Verify that the algorithms have been implemented correctly.

3. Verify that the user interface is functioning correctly.

## Resolving Issues
1. If the input data is incorrect or in the wrong format, correct the data and rerun the modeling.

2. If the implementation of the algorithms is incorrect, correct the implementation and rerun the modeling.

3. If the user interface is not functioning correctly, correct the user interface code and retest.
